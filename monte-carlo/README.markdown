# Monte Carlo Rocket Simulations

Like in the simple rocket we'll generate a parametric rocket and simulate it's flight. Only this time we'll do it over and over again with randomly generated parameters.





I made a new rocket and ran a sim 1000 times.




Highest sim went to:          21.4 km

Lowest sim went to:            6.7 km

The mean sim altitude was:    11.5 km

The median sim altitude was:  11.1 km
