# Vertical Shoot Problem

Given a rocket and a fixed amount of fuel, what thrust curve gets the most altitude?

In each of our Monte Carlo runs the rocket is the exact same size and mass. The amount of propellent is the same as well as the Isp. The only thing is that changes is the thrust curve.



I ran 999 simulations.

Highest sim went to:          51.3 km

Lowest sim went to:           23.4 km

The median sim altitude was:  47.6 km
